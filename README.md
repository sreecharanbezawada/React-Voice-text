#Voice To Text

The Voice to Text project is a simple web application that allows users to convert spoken words into written text. It utilizes the Web Speech API to capture audio input from the user's microphone and transcribe it into text.

The main feature of the application is a button with a microphone icon. When the user clicks on this button, the application starts listening to their voice input through the microphone. As the user speaks, the application captures the audio and processes it using the Web Speech API's SpeechRecognition functionality.

Once the speech recognition process is complete, the transcribed text is displayed on the screen below the button. The user can see the spoken words converted into text in real-time.

The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It leverages the FontAwesomeIcon component from the `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` package to display the microphone icon. The styling of the components is done using CSS, with additional responsive design using media queries.

This Voice to Text project can be used as a starting point to develop more advanced voice recognition applications, such as voice-controlled assistants, transcription services, or voice-based input forms.
